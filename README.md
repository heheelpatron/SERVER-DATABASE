Using PHPmyadmin i created a database that can save every table using mariasql, this is meant to save information in your environment like school, tables for your students as example.

I'll try to make a web using infinty free to have a domain then create a web using html (Front end) and php (Back end) to make it more interactive and beautiful.
ALso using a relational database manage system Mysql

I have finished the project, in the last part I've made a stock of cables from my company 

The only thing I need to finish is the documentation about how to use mysql and phpmyadmin and probably give some information about infinityfree.com in case someone want to use a domain in case he wants his web to be in the net but in my case everything is on local
